Voya Framework
====

Voya Framework is an integrated full-stack Java framework for rapid web development.
It's a simple but powerful dispatch action with no configuration required (convention over configuration).


Get Started!
====

Use the VoyaServlet in the web.xml configuration file and you're good to go.
The url are mapping over conventions. <domain>/controller/method?name=john&year=1...
This url maps to a controller class method.

```
class MyBean
{
  private String name;
  private Integer year;
  
  set's...
  get's...
}


class ExampleController
{
  public void method(MyBean b)
  {
    ...
  }
}

```

Once the controller is done, a view with the same name (method.vm) is searched in the /templates dir. Whatever you return from method gets to the view as "object" variable. Voya uses Apache Velocity as the template engine for the view. So, in method.vm you'll have:

```
<html>
  ...
  <body>
    <h1>Hello $object.name</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
